  <p>There is much to say about mobile phones like how portable they are and how consistent they are, but in my opinion the cons completely outweigh the pros</p>

  <h2>Specifications</h2>
  
  <p>everything technological has specification it's the parts inside of it that make it work.</p>

  <img src="Images/Iphone15.jfif">

  <p>Take the Iphone 15 for example. The newest Iphone, (at the time of writing this.) the parts inside this are as follows</p>

  <ul>
<li>Capacity - between 128GB - 256GB - 512GB</li>
<li>6-core CPU with 2 performance and 4 efficiency cores</li>
<li>5-core GPU</li>                  
<li>16-core Neural engine</li>
<li>A16 bionic chip</li>    
  </ul>

<h3>Overall</h3>
  
  <p>all the specs are pretty good for a mobile phone yet it still has major issues like overheating and horrible durability and remember we are trying for something that last 8 years minimum and I dont think <a href ="https://www.androidauthority.com/iphone-15-pro-max-durability-tests-3367625/">this</a> is gonna last more than a year. This isnt all though as Iphones get outdated and become irrelevant really easily.</p>
