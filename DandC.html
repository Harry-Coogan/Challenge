<h2>Consoles</h2>  
<img src = "Images/Xbox-Emblem.png" width = "75" height = "50">

<p>Consoles. usually the first thing people buy if they try to get into gaming for good reasons the most companies that own the consoles take care and are pretty understanding to their community. but other than game they cant really do too much.</p>

  <h3>Overall</h3>

  <p>These specs are very good especially with the adaptible cooling system, but even with all of these amazing features theres nothing more you can do other than play games. The Xbox series X may well last 8 years but definitely not in good condition after the fact. </p>

<h2>Laptops</h2>
<img src = "Images/GamingLap.jpg" width ="100" height = "75">
<p>Laptops are a pretty good option for daily use and can be used for lots of things like work and researching. Laptops can also be used for gaming but are nowhere near as good as as others mostly because they have a high chance of overheating because of how compact they are and what they can run.</p>

<p>Let's take the Surface Laptop 5 and take a look at it's specs.</p>  

<ul>
<li> 12th Gen Intel® Core™ i5/i7 processors</li>
  <li> Intel® Evo™ platform</li>
  <li>Lightning-fast Thunderbolt™ 4</li>
  <li>4k monitor</li>
  <li>Intel® Iris® Xe Graphics</li>
  <li>8GB, 16GB LPDDR5x RAM</li>
  <li>Removable solid-state drive (SSD) options: 256GB, 512GB</li>
</ul>

<h3>Overall</h3>

<p>For a Laptop made recently it's amazing from the RAM down to the display while all of it is amazing there is no cooling system so have fun trying to run something big on this thing. but considering the fact there is no fan it still runs small programs and software pretty well. Will it last 8 years though? in an honest answer probably not depending on how well you take care of it things can easily get stuck inside the laptop and cause a complete malfunction.</p>
